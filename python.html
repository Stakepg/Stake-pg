  <th>Multi Words Variable Names = Multi Words Variable Names,Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
      Camel Case = camelCase is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized, except for the first word. The camelCase naming convention makes compound names more readable. ... For example, myOneMethod is easier to read than myonemethod
      Pascal Case = Pascal case -- or PascalCase -- is a programming naming convention where the first letter of each compound word in a variable is capitalized. The use of descriptive variable names is a software development best practice. However, modern programming languages do not allow variables names to include blank spaces.
      Snake Case = Snake case (stylized as snake_case) refers to the style of writing in which each space is replaced by an underscore (_) character, and the first letter of each word written in lowercase. It is a commonly used naming convention in computing, for example for variable and subroutine names, and for filenames.
